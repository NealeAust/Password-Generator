# Password-Generator

## Project Title

To build a random password generator that automically generates a strong and unpredictable password in accordance with parameters entered by the user.  

## Password Generator Webpage

The Password Generator webpage is a functional and easy to use random password generator that has been built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript

### Functionality

Upon clicking on the 'Generate Password' button to start the process a prompt appears for the user to enter the length of their password, between 8 and 128 characters. Once entered and validated, a series of four prompts will appear for the user to select the character types to be included: 
- Lower case letters (a, b, c, d...)
- Upper case letters (A, B, C, D...)
- Numbers (1,2,3,4...)
- Symbols (@, &, /, !...)

The application has built in business rules so if the length is outside the specified range an alert is displayed. When the user clicks the OK button, the process is terminated. The business rule for character types is that 'at least one character typeâ€™ must be selected, otherwise an alert is displayed. When the user clicks the OK button, the process is terminated. 

If the criteria entered is within the required parameters, the application will immediately return and display a random password. The length and character types included determine how strong the password is.
